# RBbattleGreenBitSolver

Only works for lvl with 2 bombs only, so sad

also very inefficient (4 nested for loop)

# Usage
1. download the code, put them inside the SAME folder
2. download and open thonny
3. in thonny, tools->packages and install pygame from there
4. run bombsolver.py
5. input where the red square are
6. press "test" button
7. enjoy some a bit lag 

P.S: (press STOP button in thonny to close the solver in case there is problem)
